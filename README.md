#ReactiveMongo Access Controller

`ReactiveMongoAccessController` is a library built on top of the [`ReactiveMongo`](https://github.com/ReactiveMongo/ReactiveMongo) permitting you a safe and easy way to check the access rights on your mongodb data.

It implements a minimalist users, user groups and sessions handling.

Most of the API has been taken from the `ReactiveMongo` so you can use it the same way you are used to do.
